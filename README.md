## Ruby HashMap for TOP

My very first hash map implementation, right after
the linked list!

### Methods:

- **#hash(key)** -> Takes in a key and returns its hash code.
- **#set(key, value)** -> Creates a node and adds it to the hash map.
- **#get** -> Gets the value corresponding to its key in the hash map.
- **#has?** -> Returns true or false based on whether a key is in the hash map or not.
- **#remove(key)** -> Removes the key & value pair and returns its value, else nil.
- **#length** -> Returns the number of stored keys in the hash map.

- **#clear** -> Takes in a key and returns its hash code.

- **#keys** -> Returns an array with all the keys in the hash map.

- **#values** -> Same as above, but with values.

- **#values** -> Returns an array with each key & value pair inside of it as a small array.

*E.g.: [[first_key, first_value], [second_key, second_value]]*
